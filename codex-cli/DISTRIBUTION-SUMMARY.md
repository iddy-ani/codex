# Intel Codex CLI - Complete Distribution Package

## Summary

Successfully created a complete Intel Codex CLI distribution package with:

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Hardcoded Azure OpenAI credentials** for Intel's internal endpoint
- **Global Windows installation** capability via npm
- **Complete cross-platform support** with Node.js 22+
- **Pre-configured for Intel network** with proxy bypass

### ✅ User Tracking Implementation
- **MongoDB integration** with Intel's ExpertGPTDB database
- **LDAP user lookup** via Intel's internal ldapagator service
- **Privacy-focused tracking** - only email, timestamp, and method
- **Failure-resistant design** - tracking errors don't break CLI functionality
- **Rate limiting** - only tracks once per hour per user

### ✅ Installation Infrastructure
- **Automated installation scripts** (both .bat and .ps1)
- **Node.js version validation** and helpful error messages
- **Uninstallation scripts** for clean removal
- **Comprehensive documentation** with troubleshooting guide
- **Quick-install option** for easy deployment

### ✅ Distribution Package Contents

```

## User Experience

1. **Download & Extract** the `intel-codex-cli-windows` folder
2. **Run QUICK-INSTALL.bat** as Administrator
3. **Open any Command Prompt/PowerShell** in any directory
4. **Use `codex "your prompt"`** - works immediately
5. **Automatic tracking** occurs transparently in background

## Technical Implementation

### User Tracking Architecture
```typescript
// Automatic tracking on CLI startup
trackCLIUsage() -> 
  getUserEmail(os.userInfo().username) ->
  ldapagator.apps1-ir-int.icloud.intel.com ->
  MongoDB ExpertGPTDB.tracking collection
```

### Key Technical Features
- **Dynamic MongoDB import** to avoid build-time dependency issues
- **Graceful failure handling** for network/database issues
- **SSL verification bypass** for Intel internal services
- **Hour-based deduplication** to prevent tracking spam

## Installation for Intel Engineers

### Method 1: Quick Install (Recommended)
```cmd
1. Extract intel-codex-cli-windows.zip
2. Right-click QUICK-INSTALL.bat → "Run as Administrator"
3. Follow the prompts
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation
```cmd
1. Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed
2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
3. cd path\to\intel-codex-cli-windows
4. npm install -g .
```

### Usage Examples
```cmd
# Navigate to any project
cd C:\your\project

# Use the CLI
codex "explain this codebase"
codex "fix any build errors"
codex "add error handling to this function"
codex "write unit tests for this module"
```

## Security & Privacy

- **Embedded credentials** - no external API key setup required
- **Internal network only** - uses Intel's Azure OpenAI endpoint
- **Minimal tracking** - only usage statistics, no code content
- **Secure transmission** - all data stays within Intel infrastructure

## Distribution Ready

The package is ready for distribution to Intel engineering teams. Engineers can:
1. Download the zip file
2. Extract and run QUICK-INSTALL.bat
3. Start using `codex` from any directory immediately

All dependencies, documentation, and installation scripts are included in the single distribution package.
